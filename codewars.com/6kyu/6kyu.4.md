**DESCRIPTION:**

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!
```
find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
```
It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

# Solution

```
def find_uniq(arr):
    a, b = set(arr)
    return a if arr.count(a) == 1 else b
```
